HOW TO USE
1. Prepare the two image files (ex. YFP and CFP images) and put the csv files from deeplabcut.
   The current version assumes csv files with 3 ROIs that is generated by the network of "njIs110-Shunji--2019-11-25_3".
2. Replace all the words of "FileName" in the script with your file name (ex. IK3212_20200101).
   This will replace the words in lines 7, 26,, and so on.
3. Set the initial frame and final frame numbers in lines 13 and 14. 
4. Set the radius of your analysis in lines 29-31. This is to set the radius of circle for
   calculating the intensity of the image.
5. Run the program
6. Adjust the position of circiles, if neccessary (or delete the circile if ROI is absent from the images)
7. Hit return if all the positions are correct
8. Once you reached the end of the movie, a csv file is generated.
